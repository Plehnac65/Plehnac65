I hope your day is going well. Holy smokes, I saw the role posted for Indeed and got really excited because it looks like a great role. 
I saw there were already 200+ applications... (you're probably very busy reviewing them!) 
If this helps you in your reviewing process at all, I wanted to send a message to let you know that I feel 
like my application fits the role description, I believe I have a lot I could offer to the company.
Clearly more than just me think Big-Hearts Home Healthcare, would be a great place to work at!
Hope to hear from you soon and good luck with all of the applicants.
